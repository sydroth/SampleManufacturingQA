## Sample Product Manufacturing Quality Assurance

This repository is a sample project demonstrating machine learning classification to determine whether fictional produced units
are either ready to ship to customers or should be flagged for flawed manufacturing and sent to secondary inspection.

The classification models focused on reducing false negatives through evaluation of recall scores.

This repository contains the following:
* Data
* A notebook with data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling
* PDF of business-facing report on findings

### Stack
  - Python
  - Scikit Learn

### Machine Learning Models
